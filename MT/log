For Merkle Tree, can either store the value only into an array or store the Node(value, left_child, right_chid) into a list. 

MerkleRoot_v1 is for calculating the merkle root only.

MerkleTree.py is the class to save all value into an array.

DataStr_MT is the one with self built Node class, which is not really efficient, will be improved later.
